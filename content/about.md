My name is Logan Davidson. I was born and raised in Westminster, Colorado, USA, a suburb of Denver, Colorado. I am an explorer, traveler, engineer, artist, nature enthusiast, vegetarian, and graduated from the University of Southern California with B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in May of 2018.

My daily intention is to use the knowledge and skillsets I acquire to do what I can to make the world a more caring, equitable, sustainable place that it was the day before. On my blog, you can find examples of the Data Science work I have completed, places I have traveled to, some of my favorite art pieces and more. Any questions?
